## Payroll App

This is a test assignment for an interview.

Demo preview is available here: [https://payroll-two.vercel.app/](https://payroll-two.vercel.app/)

This application allows you to calculate salary after swedish taxes depending on profession, experience, city and income year.
The application is split into slides with one question shown at a time for better UX.

## Tech

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Extra packages:

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#motivation) (for css-in-js)
- [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) (for feature tests)

## UX

For design I took inspiration from [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/templates/) which are really good at user-friendly forms.

To decide on colors I used a pastel colour palete from [here](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1147)

## Getting Started

Verify that you have Node LTS installed.

`git clone` the repository

`npm install` to install the dependencies

`npm start` to run the app in the development mode

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

To test the button component, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
The React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React
components.

### `npm run cypress`

To run [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) tests

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

### `npm run eject`

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your
project.

## Deployment

This application is deployed at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
